        <p>All modern websites and web applications are built using three fundamental tehnologies: HTML, CSS and <br>JavaScript. These are the languages of the web. <br> <br>
         In this post, let's focus on HTML. We will learn what HTML is all about, and why you too should learn it.</p> 
        
        <h3>What is HTML?</h3>

        <p>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It's a markup language thet web developers use to structure  and <br> discribe the content of a webpage (not a programming language). <br>
          <br> HTML consisits elements that describe different types of content:paragraphs, linjs, headings,images, video,<br> etc. Web browsers understand HTML and render HTML code as websites.<br><br>
          In HTML, each elemnt is made up of 3 parts:</p>
         
        <ol>
            <li>The opening tag</li>
            <li>The closing tag</li>
            <li>The actual element</li>
        </ol> 
         
        <h3>Why should you learn HTML</h3>
        

        <p>There are countless reasons for learning the fundamental language of the web. Here are 5 of them:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>To be able to use the fundamental web dev language</li>
            <li>To hand-craft beautiful websites instead of relying on tools like Worpress or Wix.</li>
            <li>To build web applications</li>
            <li>To impress friends</li>
            <li>To have fun </li>
        </ul>
